Ludum Dare 35 48h entry

<p>
	Werewolf is a game made for the Ludum Dare 35 game jam competition.
	It's made by a single person, from scratch, in less than 48 hours.

	The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Osthekake/LD35">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>This game was made with the use of js libraries:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bootstrap (also css)</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>Handlebars</li>
</ul>

<h3>I have used a couple of photos found on Google image search:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Paper texture from www.wildtextures.com</li>
	<li>Blood moon - I was unable to trace the origin of this, a lot of sites used it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I used these free fonts:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Werewolf font</li>
	<li>Van Helsing font</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the art and code is made entirely by me - Osthekake (Andreas)</p>

<i>Enjoy the game!</i>
